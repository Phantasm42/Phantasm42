# About RoozerXC ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
Hey everyone, it's time I take a moment to talk about myself. My name is **Trevor**, although you can call me Roozy, Roozer or any variation of it. Whether it be Rooster, Roxanne, Rozzy, or whatever, it's fine ;0

I usually mod Amnesia: The Dark Descent but not all too much due to my demotivation. I'm working on overcoming it at some point

# Specs
I have two computers. Boop
## Acer Aspire A515-43-R19L
The PNY DDR4 DRAM in this PC sucks and crashes ReviOS 10 sometimes. I plan to fix it sometime soon
- AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 3 3200U Mobile Processor with AMD Radeonâ„¢ Vega 3 Graphics
- PNY 8GB DDR4 DRAM @ 2666MHz
## HP Compaq 8200 Elite Convertible Minitower PC
Just a quick heads up: I'm gonna be restoring and reusing this PC again hopefully in the end of this year. Since I've been interested of Linux and KVM stuff I could give this computer a blow again, switching out the old mechanical hard drives, installing a specific distro and see what else I can do with it
- ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mini (Extra RX 6400 GPU coming soon)
- 20GB DDR3 RAM (32GB upgrade coming soon)
- IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i5-2500 (i7-2600 upgrade coming soon)
- Stock 320W power supply (750W ATX power supply coming soon)
